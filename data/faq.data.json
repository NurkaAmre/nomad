    "query": "Travel Visa",
    "answer": "A travel visa is a document issued by a foreign country that provides permission for you to gain entry into that country. It is your responsibility to determine whether you need a visa to enter your destination country or countries, or whether you need any additional travel documents. Requirements vary by destination and change periodically. You should check with the consulates of the countries you plan to visit for the most up-to-date information. Requirements may include, but are not limited to, having a passport with at least six months validity remaining, a round-trip airline ticket, and proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay. You may also be required to have a medical exam, proof of lodging arrangements, and/or a letter of invitation from a resident of the country you are visiting."

    "query": "Best season to travel",
    "answer": "The best time to visit a destination depends on several factors: weather, peak travel season, and festivals. Weather is often the first consideration when deciding when to visit a destination. Before you book your trip, check the average temperatures and rainfall in the destination you plan to visit. You can find this information on the Internet or in a guidebook. You should also consider whether you want to travel during the destination's peak travel season. Peak travel season varies by destination, but it generally refers to the time of year when the most tourists visit a destination. Peak travel season is usually the most expensive time to visit a destination. If you want to avoid crowds and save money, you may want to consider traveling during the destination's off-peak season. Finally, you should consider whether you want to visit a destination during a festival or other special event. Festivals and special events can be a great way to experience a destination's culture, but they can also make it more difficult to find lodging and transportation."
